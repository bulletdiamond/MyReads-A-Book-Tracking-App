# MyReads A Book Tracking App

This is my project for the Front-End Nanodegree with Udacity.
it is a book tracking app allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

And of course, you can search and add more books to the Shelfs.

## Functionality
In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
